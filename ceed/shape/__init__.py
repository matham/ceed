.. _shape-api:

Shapes
======

Defines the shapes which are used with a :mod:`ceed.function` to create regions
with time-varying intensity during an experiment :mod:`ceed.stage`.

:class:`~kivy_garden.painter.PaintCanvasBehavior` provides the widget
functionality such that when a user draws on the screen,
:class:`~kivy_garden.painter.PaintShape` instances are created and added to
it.

:class:`CeedPaintCanvasBehavior` provides a more specialized painter canvas.
Specifically, in addition to being able to draw shapes, it adds the ability
to organize shapes into :attr:`CeedPaintCanvasBehavior.groups`.

.. _shape-plugin:

Shape plugin
------------

Although Ceed does not offer a plugin for shapes, it's simple to create shapes
and shape groups with a script, dump it to disk as a yaml file, and import it
into Ceed from the GUI.

Following is an example using :class:`CeedPaintCanvasBehavior` and the methods
of its baseclass :class:`~kivy_garden.painter.PaintCanvasBehavior` as well
as using the Ceed-inherited versions of the shapes;
:class:`CeedPaintCircle` (:class:`~kivy_garden.painter.PaintCircle`),
:class:`CeedPaintEllipse` (:class:`~kivy_garden.painter.PaintEllipse`),
:class:`CeedPaintPolygon` (:class:`~kivy_garden.painter.PaintPolygon`).

Each shape class has a class method ``create_shape`` that can be used to create
the shape, because you should not instantiate the shape class manually because
the resulting shapes may not be valid:

.. code-block:: python

    from ceed.shape import CeedPaintCanvasBehavior, CeedPaintCircle, \
        CeedPaintEllipse, CeedPaintPolygon
    from ceed.storage.controller import CeedDataWriterBase

    # create shape factory to which we'll add shapes
    shape_factory = CeedPaintCanvasBehavior()
    # create the shapes and name them. We use the Shape classes from Ceed
    ellipse = CeedPaintEllipse.create_shape(
        center=(250, 450), radius_x=200, radius_y=400, name='ellipse')
    circle = CeedPaintCircle.create_shape(
        center=(700, 300), radius=200, name='circle')
    polygon = CeedPaintPolygon.create_shape(
        points=[275, 300, 700, 300, 500, 800], name='polygon')

    # add the shapes to factory
    shape_factory.add_shape(ellipse)
    shape_factory.add_shape(circle)
    shape_factory.add_shape(polygon)

    # create group, name it, and add shapes to it
    group = shape_factory.add_group()
    group.name = 'shapes'
    group.add_shape(ellipse)
    group.add_shape(polygon)

    # save it to disk for import later
    CeedDataWriterBase.save_config_to_yaml(
        filename, shape_factory=shape_factory)

You can also create the shapes by type name using
:meth:`~kivy_garden.painter.PaintCanvasBehavior.create_shape`:

.. code-block:: python

    from ceed.shape import CeedPaintCanvasBehavior
    from ceed.storage.controller import CeedDataWriterBase

    # create shape factory to which we'll add shapes
    shape_factory = CeedPaintCanvasBehavior()

    # create shape using config, including name
    ellipse = shape_factory.create_shape(
        'ellipse', center=(250, 450), radius_x=200, radius_y=400,
        name='ellipse')
    circle = shape_factory.create_shape(
        'circle', center=(700, 300), radius=200, name='circle')
    polygon = shape_factory.create_shape(
        'polygon', points=[275, 300, 700, 300, 500, 800], name='polygon')

    # add the shapes to factory
    shape_factory.add_shape(ellipse)
    shape_factory.add_shape(circle)
    shape_factory.add_shape(polygon)

    # create group, name it, and add shapes to it
    group = shape_factory.add_group()
    group.name = 'shapes'
    group.add_shape(ellipse)
    group.add_shape(polygon)

    # save it to disk for import later
    CeedDataWriterBase.save_config_to_yaml(
        filename, shape_factory=shape_factory)

See :meth:`~ceed.storage.controller.CeedDataWriterBase.\
add_frame.save_config_to_yaml`
for a full example with functions/stages.

If you need to create many shapes or groups and importing them in the Ceed GUI
is slow, consider setting its :attr:`~CeedShape.no_display` or
:attr:`~CeedShapeGroup.no_display` to True. E.g.
``CeedPaintEllipse.create_shape(..., no_display=True)``.

The ProPixx projector used by Ceed has a resolution of 1920x108, so that should
be the maximum extent of the shapes. The exact available drawing area can also
be read/set in the config at
:attr:`~ceed.view.controller.ViewControllerBase.screen_width` and
:attr:`~ceed.view.controller.ViewControllerBase.screen_height`.
