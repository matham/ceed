.. _view-api:

Experiment Controller
=====================

Runs, controls, and displays Ceed experiments on screen, both during a "real"
experiment and when previewing it.

The purpose of Ceed is to run visual-temporal experiments. Once a
:mod:`~ceed.stage` containing one or more :mod:`~ceed.function`
and one or more :mod:`~ceed.shape` has been designed, you're ready to run
the experiment.

Following are some of the experiment configuration options:

.. _view-flip:

Camera-projector-array alignment
--------------------------------

There are three systems interacting with the tissue, and they all need to be
aligned to each other; the projector, the camera, and the MEA electrode grid.

Camera-projector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first step is to draw any unique shape in Ceed and project this pattern
on the MEA plane and then capture the projected pattern using the camera.
Then in the GUI scale and align the captured image to the original shape. This
will give us the camera to projector :attr:`ViewControllerBase.cam_transform`
matrix.

With the camera aligned to the projector output, you can draw shapes and target
specific regions of the slice, visually (from a broad field stimulation camera
capture) and it will be projected at the correct place on the tissue. If
there's mirroring, making affine alignment impossible you can either
:attr:`ViewControllerBase.flip_camera` or
:attr:`ViewControllerBase.flip_projector` horizontally. These settings are
also exposed in the GUI.

Camera-array
^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the camera aligned to the projector, we just need to align the MEA grid to
the camera. First take a camera picture of the grid - you should be able to see
the 2D grid of electrode termination points. Then, in the GUI display the
virtual grid defined by :attr:`ViewControllerBase.mea_num_rows`,
:attr:`ViewControllerBase.mea_num_cols`,
:attr:`ViewControllerBase.mea_pitch`,
:attr:`ViewControllerBase.mea_diameter`, and
:attr:`ViewControllerBase.mirror_mea` and manually align it to the image.
This will generate the :attr:`ViewControllerBase.mea_transform`.

With the array aligned to the image and the projector aligned to the image
we can now know exactly the electrodes on which the drawn shapes will cover
and we can relate the activity of those cells to the stimulation.

.. _view-video-mode:

Video mode
----------

The projector supports 120 (119.96 more accurately) frames per second at its
full resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, but it also offers higher speed modes.

It can split the GPU image into 4 quadrants, such that it renders 4 960x540
pixel images for each overall frame. So at the cost of a half of the x, y
resolution we can play at 480Hz.

Normally each image has red, green, and blue channels. By instead outputting
a grayscale image, we can use each of the three channels to further multiply
our speed by three to render 960x540 grayscale at 1,440 Hz.

The video mode is configurable with :attr:`ViewControllerBase.video_mode`
and from the GUI. Ceed will automatically correctly render the images for each
mode when it is selected.

LED mode
--------

The projector has three LEDs; red, green, and blue. In Ceed you can draw shapes
and select their color(s). Internally, the projector will uses its LEDs to
display the image with the requested colors, like a normal projector.

However, you can manually turn OFF each of these LEDs and then that color will
be displayed. :attr:`ViewControllerBase.LED_mode_idle`
and :attr:`ViewControllerBase.LED_mode` configure which LEDs are active outside
and during an experiment, respectively.

Typically you'd select ``'none'`` for :attr:`ViewControllerBase.LED_mode_idle`
so that the projector is OFF outside the experiment. This way you don't
stimulate the tissue outside the experiment. During the experiment you can
either rely on the color selected for each stage, turn OFF specific LEDs or use
the optical filters to filter out unwanted color channels.

.. _dropped-frames:

Frame rate and dropped frames
-----------------------------

Frame time
^^^^^^^^^^

The projector and GPU display frames at a specific
:attr:`ViewControllerBase.frame_rate`. In Ceed (GUI) you must enter the exact
GPU frame rate, otherwise Ceed will project the stages at an incorrect rate.
The frame rate will be internally converted to a fraction
(:attr:`ViewControllerBase.frame_rate_numerator`,
:attr:`ViewControllerBase.frame_rate_denominator`) that will be used to clock
the functions (see below).

Normally, the GPU limits us to the frame rate so we don't have to estimate from
software when to display the next frame, because we immediately display the next
frame when the GPU returns control to the CPU. However, if it's not available,
:attr:`ViewControllerBase.use_software_frame_rate` can be used to force the
frame rate. Although it's very unreliable and should not be used during an
experiment.

Long frames
^^^^^^^^^^^

In an ideal system, every frame is displayed for exactly the duration of
the period of the frame_rate before displaying the next frame. In this system
the time of each frame is 0, 1 * period,, 2 * period, ..., n * period.
Since the period is an exact fraction, the current time can be expressed as an
exact fraction and when passed to a stage's function it can accurately determine
when each function is done.

In a real system, some frames may be displayed for more than one frame duration.
This could happen if the CPU is too slow then the current frame is e.g.
displayed for 2 or more frames before the next frame is shown. If this is not
accounted for, all subsequent frames are temporally displaced by the number of
long frames.

For example, say the frame rate and period is exactly 1 second. Normally, we'd
display frames at 0s, 1s, ... ns, and use that time when computing the functions
for each frame (i.e. multiplying the frame count by the period to get the time).
Naively, if we display frame 0 at 0s, 1 at 1s, 2 at 2s. But then frame 2
actually goes long and is displayed for 2 seconds. Because we're counting
frames, the next frame time will be computed as frame 3 at 3s. However, in real
time, because frame 2 was two frames long the actual frame 3 time is 4s when
frame 3 is displayed. So all frames are delayed.

Dropping frames
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To fix this, frame 3 should be dropped and we should instead display frame 4
next. Or more generally, we need to drop frames until the frame number times the
period catches up with the real time.

Ceed has two approaches to detecting when to drop frames; a software approach
and a hardware approach. The software approach uses the time after rendering
frames and a median filter for :class:`FrameEstimation`. With default settings
it may take a few frames before we correct the delay.

We also have a hardware solution using a `Teensy device
<https://github.com/matham/ceed/tree/master/ceed/view/teensy_estimation>`_
for :class:`TeensyFrameEstimation`. This device watches for dropped frames
and notifies us over USB when it happens. This lets us respond more quickly.

The hardware device can be turned OFF with
:attr:`TeensyFrameEstimation.use_teensy`, which is also configurable in the GUI.
If disabled, we fall back to the software approach, unless it's completely
disabled with :attr:`ViewControllerBase.skip_estimated_missed_frames`.

.. note::

    For any dropped frames, we still pass the time to the stage and it generates
    the shape values for these frames, but the frames are just dropped.

    This ensures that the root stage receives contiguous times at the given
    frame rate without any jumps, rather, we just don't draw the frames that
    need to be skipped.

Experiment flow
---------------

Following is the overall experiment flow and what Ceed does when running an
experiment.

Experiment mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two modes under which the experiment runs; in **preview mode** or as
a "real" experiment. In preview mode, the stage is run directly in the Ceed
GUI in the drawing area but is not projected on the projector (unless the
:attr:`~ViewControllerBase.LED_mode_idle` is not ``none``). All the code is
executed within the main Ceed process and the controller used to control the
experiment is a :class:`ControllerSideViewControllerBase` instance.

In a **"real"** experiment, the user launches a second full screen window from
within Ceed. This starts a new process that communicates with Ceed over a queue
and runs the experiment in that fullscreen window. In
this case, the controller in the second process is a
:class:`ViewSideViewControllerBase` instance, but the main GUI still has its
:class:`ControllerSideViewControllerBase` instance through it communicates with
the :class:`ViewSideViewControllerBase` instance. Data is constantly
sent between the two processes, specifically, the second process is
initialized with the config at the start. Then, once the playing
starts, the client (second process) continuously sends data back to the main
Ceed GUI for processing and storage.

Experiment control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When running from the full-screen window, you can control the experiment
using keyboard shortcuts. Specifically, the following shortcuts:

* ``ctrl-s`` starts an experiment using the currently selected stage (selected
  in the Ceed GUI).
* ``ctrl-c`` stops the currently running experiment.
* ``ctrl-z`` stops the currently running experiment (if any) and closes the
  fullscreen window.
* ``ctrl-f`` toggles the second window between fullscreen and normal. This
  should not really be used.

If previewing, you can start or stop the stage using the play button in the GUI.

Preparing stage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the user starts the experiment, starting with the stage selected by the
user, Ceed copies the stage into a new
stage named :attr:`~ceed.stage.last_experiment_stage_name`. If one already
exists with that name, it is replaced. This is the stage that will be run
and the name of the stage you should look up in the analysis stage.

Given the stage, it samples all the randomized function parameters, it expands
all the reference stages and functions, and it re-samples the function
parameters not marked as
:attr:`~ceed.function.param_noise.NoiseBase.lock_after_forked`. See
:meth:`~ceed.stage.CeedStage.copy_and_resample`.

Preparing hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, it prepares a new section in the data file for this experiment (see
:meth:`~ceed.storage.controller.prepare_experiment`). It then set the video
mode (:attr:`~ViewControllerBase.video_mode`) and LED state
(:attr:`~ViewControllerBase.LED_mode`) to the requested state and it is ready
to run the stage.

If it's running for "real" and not being previewed, Ceed tell the second process
to start the stage in the second full-screen window. It also starts
communication with the :class:`TeensyFrameEstimation` if it's being used. Now,
it sets up all the graphics and everything it needs to run.

Warmup
^^^^^^

When starting the stage, the stage will pre-compute the intensity values for all
its frames if enabled (:ref:`pre-compute`). For a long experiment, this may take
some time during which the GUI won't update. If the Teensy is running, the
Teensy's LED will blink faster than normal until the pre-computing and warmup is
done and the stage actually starts playing frames when it will blink even
faster until the stage is done.

When pre-computing is done, Ceed will run 50 blank frames. This gives sufficient
time to make sure :attr:`~ViewControllerBase.LED_mode` is updated. It also
allows us to collect the rendering time of these warmup frames, which will then
be used to initialize :class:`FrameEstimation` to help us estimate when to drop
frames as a fallback if Teensy is not available.

Running stage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the stage, Ceed will sample the stage's function at integer multiples of
the period of the GPU refresh rate (:attr:`~ViewControllerBase.frame_rate` or
rather :attr:`~ViewControllerBase.effective_frame_rate` if any of the quad
modes is ON). Specifically, Ceed counts GPU frames and increments the counter by
one for each frame (or sub-frame if the quad mode is ON). So to compute the
current frame time, it divides :attr:`~ViewControllerBase.count` by
:attr:`~ViewControllerBase.effective_frame_rate`.

Hence :attr:`~ViewControllerBase.frame_rate` **must be exactly the GPU refresh
rate**. E.g. if the GPU is updating at 119.96 (which is typical), the frame
rate must be set to ``119.96``, and not ``120``.

At each frame or sub-frame, Ceed ticks the stage with the current frame time.
This causes it to update all the shapes to the stage's function intensity and
for the new frame to be rendered.

As the experiment is running Ceed also logs all the shape data. It stores for
each frame the intensity of all shapes as well as some minimal debug data about
frame time. More debug data can be logged by turning ON
:attr:`ViewControllerBase.log_debug_timing`. It also logs the corner pixel
Ceed-MCS alignment pattern for each frame, to be used for later alignment
(see :ref:`exp-sync`).

Experiment shutdown
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the experiment finishes or is stopped, Ceed will save the last camera image
just before the experiment stops (
:attr:`~ControllerSideViewControllerBase.last_cam_image`), if the camera was
playing. Then it stops the stage (if it didn't naturally stop) and cleans up.

.. _exp-sync:

Synchronization
---------------

To facilitate temporal data alignment between the Ceed data (each projected
frame) and MCS (the electrode data), Ceed outputs a bit pattern in the
top-left corner pixel for each frame. This pixel is output by the projector
controller as a bit pattern on its digital port, and is recorded by MCS.
It is turned ON just before the experiment starts when running a "real"
experiment using :meth:`ControllerSideViewControllerBase.set_pixel_mode`.

Specifically, the corner pixel contains 24-bits (8 for red, green, and blue).
Ceed sends synchronization data in this pixel, so that after an experiment
Ceed can look at its frame and the MCS data that logged the pattern and it
can figure out exactly the electrode samples that corresponds to each projected
frame.

See :class:`~ceed.storage.controller.DataSerializerBase` to see the details
about this pattern. See also :ref:`handshake-protocol` to see how it used
used to merge the data after an experiment.

class FrameEstimation:
    """A window-based running-median estimator.

    Starting from the first frame, you pass it (:meth:`add_frame`) the time
    just after each frame is rendered. With that, it estimates the time
    the first frame was rendered by estimating the whole number of frames passed
    since :attr:`first_frame_time`, rounding, and then back-computing the first
    frame time from the current frame time, the count, and the GPU period.

    So, each frame gives us an estimate of when the first frame was rendered.
    Next, we keep a :attr:`history` of this estimate from the last 100 frames
    and its median is the best estimate for the actual first frame render time.

    Next, given the best estimate of the first frame render time and the period,
    we compute how many frames have passed and round to whole frames. We record
    this number for the last ``n`` (:attr:`skip_detection_smoothing_n_frames`)
    frames in the circular :attr:`render_times` buffer. Our assumption is that
    starting from the first of the ``n`` frames until the nth frame, we should
    have rendered ``n - 1`` frames.

    Averaging this over the ``n`` frames, so that we are less sensitive to
    individual frame jitter, we get the best estimate of how many frames we
    should have rendered by now, given the start time and the period.
    Additionally, globally, we keep count of the total number of frame actually
    submitted to the GPU and rendered. If our estimate for the number of frames
    we should have rendered is larger than the number of actual rendered,
    we know that some frame took to long to render and we need to drop one or
    more frames to compensate.

    :meth:`add_frame` returns now many frames need to be dropped to catch up.
